Titanic Dataset: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Project Overview
This project focuses on performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset, available on Kaggle. The goal is to explore relationships between variables, identify patterns and trends, and provide insights that could be useful for predicting survival on the Titanic.

Dataset
The Titanic dataset provides information about passengers, including attributes such as age, gender, class, fare, and survival status. The dataset is accessible at the Kaggle Titanic Competition Page.

Key Objectives:

Perform data cleaning to address missing or inconsistent values.
Conduct EDA to understand the distribution of key variables.
Explore relationships between different features and survival rates.
Visualize insights and trends in the data.
Steps Involved
Data Cleaning:

Handling missing values (e.g., age, embarked).
Encoding categorical variables for analysis.
Standardizing and transforming variables where needed.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizing the distribution of numerical and categorical features.
Analyzing survival rates across different passenger groups (e.g., class, gender).
Exploring correlations among features to gain deeper insights.

Data Visualization:

Used Seaborn and Matplotlib to create informative plots.
Visualized the impact of variables such as age, gender, and class on survival rates.
Plotted trends and distributions for a clearer understanding of the data.

Technologies and Tools Used:

Python: Core programming language for data analysis.
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
Seaborn & Matplotlib: Data visualization libraries.
Jupyter Notebook: For an interactive coding environment.

Skills Gained:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data Visualization
Pattern Recognition in Data

How to Use This Repository:

Download the Titanic dataset from Kaggle and place it in the /data folder.
Open the Jupyter Notebook Data Exploratory Titanic Dataset.ipynb and run each cell to perform data cleaning and EDA.
Review the visualizations and insights generated to understand key patterns in the data.

Results and Insights:

This analysis provides insights into the factors affecting passenger survival on the Titanic, showing how demographics and travel class played a significant role. Future projects could build on these insights by developing predictive models.
